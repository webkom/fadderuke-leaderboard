Docs on how to setup backend is located in **go-backend** folder, and frontend is located in **webapp** folder.


This project uses [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) as frontend. The backend is a [Golang](https://golang.org/) [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) function that makes a google-sheet document available as a basic json API.
